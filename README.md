# World_Happiness_Report_EDA
This is a data analysis project on the World Happiness Report which ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels. The report is based on a survey of the state of global happiness and provides a snapshot of the state of happiness in the world today.

The analysis is performed using the Python programming language and the data visualization library, Matplotlib. The Jupyter Notebook contains a detailed explanation of the steps taken to perform the analysis and includes comments to help the reader understand the code.

# Requirements
To run the analysis, the following packages are required:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
# Data
The data used in this analysis is taken from the World Happiness Report and includes information on various factors that contribute to the happiness levels of countries. The factors include:

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
Social support
Healthy life expectancy
Freedom to make life choices
Generosity
Perceptions of corruption
# Analysis
The analysis consists of the following steps:

Data cleaning and preparation
Exploratory data analysis
Correlation analysis
Regression analysis
The exploratory data analysis provides insights into the distribution of the data and the relationship between the various factors. The correlation analysis is used to understand the relationship between the happiness levels of countries and the different factors that contribute to it. Finally, a regression analysis is performed to understand the influence of the different factors on the happiness levels of countries.

# Conclusion
The analysis shows that the happiness levels of countries are positively correlated with their GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy. On the other hand, corruption and lack of freedom to make life choices have a negative impact on the happiness levels of countries.
